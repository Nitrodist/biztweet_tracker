# BizTweet Tracker

**An Application to track your tweets for #CM2066 (for the next week!)**

This, so far, is just a static web page (yes, I realize that we're not using the rails at all... yet) that grabs all of your tweets in your timeline for #CM2066 and displays them here.

We'll work on the app some more so that we can track the searches and you can see the weeks in which you achieved your goal of posting a tweet for #CM2066.

## Frameworks and Libraries Used

The application makes use of the following:

* [Rails 3.1](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/8/31/rails-3-1-0-has-been-released) for past searches logging (unused for now)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for general JavaScript stuff
* [TwitterLib](https://github.com/remy/twitterlib) for grabbing tweets
